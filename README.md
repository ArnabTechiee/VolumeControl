Hand Volume Control

Overview

Hand Volume Control is an innovative project that enables users to control the volume of their devices using hand gestures. This project utilizes a combination of hardware and software to detect hand movements and translate them into volume control commands.

Features

Gesture-based volume control

Real-time hand tracking

Compatibility with multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, etc.)

Easy-to-use interface

Customizable sensitivity settings

Prerequisites

Hardware Requirements:

A computer or laptop with a camera

Optional: External webcam for better tracking

Software Requirements:

Python (version 3.8 or later)

OpenCV library

Mediapipe library

Pycaw library (for Windows users only)

Other dependencies (specified in requirements.txt)

Installation

Clone the Repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/hand-volume-control.git
cd hand-volume-control

Install Required Libraries:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the Script:

python hand_volume_control.py

Usage

Launch the application.

Position your hand within the camera's field of view.

Use the following gestures to control the volume:

Move your hand up: Increase volume

Move your hand down: Decrease volume

Make a fist: Mute/unmute

Adjust sensitivity or settings as needed in the configuration file (config.json).

Configuration

Modify the config.json file to customize settings:

sensitivity: Adjust how responsive the system is to hand movements.

camera_index: Change the camera source if you have multiple cameras.

volume_range: Set the minimum and maximum volume levels.

Example:

{
  "sensitivity": 0.5,
  "camera_index": 0,
  "volume_range": [0, 100]
}

Troubleshooting

Camera not detected:
Ensure that the camera is connected and not being used by another application.

Gestures not recognized:
Check lighting conditions and ensure your hand is within the camera's view.

Volume control not working:
Confirm that Pycaw is installed (for Windows) or modify the script for macOS compatibility.
